# 🏦 Credit Risk Analysis Using SAS

This project uses SAS to build a basic credit risk model using logistic regression. The goal is to predict whether a loan applicant will default based on key financial attributes.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- SAS OnDemand for Academics
- CSV data of fictional loan applicants
- Key procedures: PROC LOGISTIC, PROC MEANS, PROC CORR, PROC SGPLOT

## 📁 Files
- `credit_risk_model.sas`: The SAS code file
- `loan_data.csv`: Simulated loan application data
- `README.md`: Project overview

## 📈 Key Analysis Steps
1. Data cleaning and formatting
2. Summary statistics for variables
3. Logistic regression model to predict default
4. Visualization of loan amount vs credit score
5. Correlation and data inspection

## 🎯 Objective
Demonstrate use of SAS for basic risk modeling in finance, with clear steps in data prep, analysis, and model building.
